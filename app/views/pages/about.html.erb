					<h1>About me</h1>
					<p>I have been programming for well over a year. I have a bachelors degree in Software development. I have certifications through Comptia, Oracle, and CIW. My highest certification is the Oracle certified Java professional programmer. I have written projects in Java, Javascript, Ruby, and Python. I have also created android applications in Java. I have utilized Spring for Java, Django and Flask for Python, Rails for Ruby and React/Redux for Javascript. I have utilized HTML, CSS, and XML on a constant. My language of preference is Java, since I have had the most experience with it, however I am very happy to work with any language. Even through all my experience I am still learning and I hope to be the best programmer that I can be.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Having coded in multiple languages, I have come to find that the success of a project is dependent on multiple
					factors. To achieve our goals as efficiently as possible, it is important that we work on ourselves as a team and as individuals on a constant basis.</p>
					<!-- Having coded in multiple languages, I have come to find that the success of a project is dependent on multiple factors. To achieve our goals as efficiently as possible, it is important that we work on ourselves as a team and as individuals on a constant basis. It is true that we should always set end goals, but the ultimate end goal should in fact be a never ending one. The goal to be the best that we can be in every way by using every accomplishment as a stepping stone to reach even greater heights than anyone else, including ourselves. -->
