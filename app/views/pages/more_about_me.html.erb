    	    <h1>More About Me</h1>
      		<p >In addition to programming, I have a great passion for health and fitness. I have a second bachelors degree in Exercise and Health Science. I have worked as a personal trainer with many clients. I have also interned at Massachusetts General Hospital for physical therapy. I competed in a few powerlifting competitions and acquired the state title for the bench press. I hope to acquire the U.S.A title one day. I competed in one bodybuilding competition and I won on my first attempt, getting my pro card. Whether it be mental or physical I strive to be the very best that I can be. </p>
