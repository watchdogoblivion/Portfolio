This project produced an application that acts as resume/portfolio. It exhibits a number of traits such as the implementation of user roles to restrict comments to guests and restrict the use of CRUD methods for specific features from normal users. The use of enums to manage data stages so that blogs can shift from draft to published and non-featured to featured easily. Implemented various custom routes, scopes, concerns, helpers and partials. Downloaded and implemented a number of ruby gems to implement features such as markdown, user management, encryption, custom fonts, pagination, icons, custom alerts and drag/drop functionalities .Created simple custom ruby gem to manage footer. Integrated the use of Action Cable to permit the the use of live updates and live data via broadcasts and websockets.
